- Configure rights management in Office 365. 
- Configure compliance features.
- Configure email protection.
- Troubleshoot security and compliance.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they aren't available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

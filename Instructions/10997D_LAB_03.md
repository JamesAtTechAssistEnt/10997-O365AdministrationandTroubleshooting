# Module 3: Administering and troubleshooting directory synchronization and directory objects
# Lab: Administering directory synchronization, users, and groups in Microsoft 365
### Scenario

Now that the Microsoft 365 tenant is configured and ready for deployment, you are ready to start creating user and group accounts in Microsoft 365. You and your team need to be familiar with how to configure these accounts by using the Microsoft 365 admin center, because this will be your primary tool for managing the environment when the pilot is fully functional. In addition, you need to make sure that directory synchronization is enabled, and that the password policy for Office 365 users matches the password policy for on-premises users.

### Objectives

 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure Azure AD Connect.

- Manage Microsoft 365 users and groups.

- Manage Microsoft 365 password policies.

- Troubleshoot users and directory synchronization.

### Lab setup

6. Enable the password writeback feature.



#### Task 3: Configure synchronization services for OUs and object attributes

1. On  **LON-DS1**, configure the Active Directory Connector in  **Synchronization Service Manager** for the **Development** OU.

2. Add the  **device** object to the synchronization list.

3. Add the  **secretary** and **street** attributes to the synchronization list.

4. On  **LON-DS1**, use the  **Synchronization Rules Editor** to configure a filter on the inbound synchronization rule with the following information:

  - Name:  **In from AD - User DoNotSyncFilter**

  - Connected System:  **Adatum.com**

  - CS Object Type:  **User**

  - Metaverse Object Type:  **Person**

  - Link Type:  **Join**

  - Precedence:  **50**

  - Scoping filter:
Attribute:  **MSDS-cloudExtensionAttribute15**

Operator:  **EQUAL**

Value:  **NoSync**

  - Transformation:
FlowType:  **Constant**

Target Attribute:  **cloudFiltered**

Source:  **True**

5. Use Windows PowerShell to start the synchronization by running the following command:

```powershell
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial
```


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured Azure AD Connect.


## Exercise 2: Managing Microsoft 365 users and groups by using the Microsoft 365 admin center

3. Delete the  **Production** group, and then confirm that **Amy Santiago** still exists in the list of **Active users**.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created users and groups in Office 365 and managed user licenses.


## Exercise 3: Managing password policies in Microsoft 365

### Scenario

 Your organization has configured a password policy for on-premises users that requires a complex password, requires users to change their passwords every 60 days, and prevents users from reusing old passwords 15 times. You need to ensure that the password policy for the pilot users on Office 365 matches the policy for on-premises users, and report any settings that can't be configured to match.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure the Office 365 password policy.

2. Validate the password policy.

3. Configure Office 365 multifactor authentication.



#### Task 1: Configure the Microsoft 365 password policy

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in  **Settings**, browse to **Org settings** and then to  **Security &amp; privacy**.

2. Set the password expiration policy to  **14** days before the passwords expire.

>  **Note:** You would not do this in the real world. This is a classroom example that allows you to verify the policy applied in the next exercise task.

3. In the  **Days before a user is notified about expiration** box, leave the default value of **14**.

4. Verify that the  **Password policy has been updated** message appears at the beginning of the page.



#### Task 2: Validate the password policy

1. Open Internet Explorer, and then browse to  [**https://portal.office.com**](https://portal.office.com).

2. Sign in as  **Lindsey\@<i></i>Customdomainname.hostdomain.com**, where ***Customdomainname.hostdomain.com*** is your unique domain name, by using temporary password noted before. Update the password to a new password that meets the complexity requirements.

3. On the top of the window, verify that the notification appears with the following information:  **Time to change your password. Your password will expire in 13 days.**

>  **Note:** It might take a several minutes before the password change notification appears. You can safely proceed with other tasks in this lab even if you don't get notification.

>  **Note:** You have now verified that your password policy is applied. In a real-world scenario, after you verified that the password policy was applied, you would need to increase the number of days before the password expired, according to your organizational policy.



#### Task 3: Configure multifactor authentication

1. Open Internet Explorer, and then browse to  [**https://portal.office.com**](https://portal.office.com).

2. Sign in as  **Holly\@Adatum*yyxxxxx*.onmicrosoft.com**, where  ***yyxxxxx*** is your unique Adatum number, with Holly's password.

3. In the Microsoft Office 365 portal, in  **Settings**, browse to **Org settings** and then to  **Services**.

4. Manage multifactor authentication and enable multifactor authentication for  **Amy Santiago**.

5. In  **service settings** for multifactor authentication, remove **Call to phone** as a verification option. Enable the option to remember multifactor authentication on trusted devices.

6. Close the browser window.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured the Office 365 password policy and validated the policy.


## Exercise 4: Troubleshooting synchronization issues with user objects in Microsoft 365

### Scenario

 You noticed that a few user objects are not synchronizing properly to Azure AD. You suspect that a few attributes on these objects do not have proper values. You want to use the IdFix tool to verify potential issues with user objects in your organization that can prevent object synchronization to Azure AD.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Produce a problem.

2. Resolve synchronization issues.



#### Task 1: Produce a problem in AD DS

- On the LON-CL1 computer, use **Manage optional features** option in Windows 10 to install **RSAT:Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Services Tools**.
- On  **LON-CL1**, set the  **Execution** policy in Windows PowerShell to **Unrestricted**, change the path to  **C:\\Labfiles\\Mod03**, and then run the Windows PowerShell cmdlet  **.\\Mod3\_CreateProblem.ps1**.
  This Windows PowerShell script will make changes in AD DS that you will need to troubleshoot.

  

#### Task 2: Resolve synchronization issues

1. On  **LON-CL1**, sign in as **Adatum\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. On  **LON-CL1**, download the IdFix tool from https://github.com/microsoft/idfix

3. Install IdFix tool.

4. In the IdFix tool, select  **Query**, and then sort the errors by the  **ERROR** column.

5. On the  **Actions** menu, select **Edit** for each of these objects, and then select **Apply**:

  -  **An Dung Dao**

  -  **Klemen Sic**

  -  **Ngoc Bich Tran**


6. Select  **Query**.

7. Remediate any remaining issues using similar approach.
8. Sign out and then sign in as **Adatum\\Holly**.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have troubleshot synchronization issues with user objects in Office 365.
